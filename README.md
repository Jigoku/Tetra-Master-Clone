# Tetra-Master-Clone
Rough remake of the card game from FFIX running on LOVE 0.10.0 and therefore should(?) run on Android/iOS.

## Current state
* All 100 original cards implemented
* All rules are implemented (I think?)
* Cards are all at their maximum potential level (though I'm not entirely sure how that works with cards levelling up)
* Both players are given entirely random hands
* Missing sprites for win/lose/perfect
* Missing some of the extra graphics (combo counter, shiny card capture transitions etc.)

## Rules
